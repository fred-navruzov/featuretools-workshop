    "\n",
    "Within this workshop, we will walk through applying automated feature engineering to the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) using the featuretools library. [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/) is an open-source Python package for automatically creating new features from multiple tables of structured, related data. It is ideal tool for problems such as the Home Credit Default Risk competition where there are several related tables that need to be combined into a single dataframe for training (and one for testing). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is to create new features (alos called explantory variables or predictors) to represent as much information from an entire dataset in one table.  Typically, this process is **\"hand-made\"** using pandas operations such as `groupby`, `agg`, or `merge` and can be very tedious. \n",
    "<br/>Moreover, manual feature engineering is limited both by human time constraints and imagination: we simply cannot conceive of every possible feature that will be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of creating the proper features cannot be overstated because a machine learning model can only learn from the data we give to it. Extracting as much information as possible from the available datasets is crucial to creating an effective solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Automated feature engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-in-python-99baf11cc219) aims to help the data scientist with the problem of feature creation by automatically building hundreds or thousands of new features from a dataset. **Featuretools - the only open-sourced library for automated feature engineering at the moment** - will not replace the data scientist's value, but will allow instead to focus on more valuable parts of the machine learning pipeline, such as delivering robust models into production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will touch on the concepts of automated feature engineering with featuretools and show how to implement it for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will stick to the basics so we can get the ideas down and then build upon this foundation in later work when we customize featuretools. We will work with **a subset of the data because this is a computationally intensive job**"

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Credit Default Risk competition is a **supervised ML task**. The objective is to use historical financial and behavioral data to predict whether or not an applicant will have difficulties repaying a loan:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Supervised__: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n",
    "* __Classification__: The label is binary:\n",
    "    - 0 (will repay loan on time)\n",
    "    - 1 (will have difficulties repaying loan)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided by [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/about-us.aspx), a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 different data files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __application_train/application_test__: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` with indicating 0: the loan was repaid and 1: the loan was not repaid. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __bureau__: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau and is identified by the `SK_ID_BUREAU`, Each loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __bureau_balance__: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __previous_application__: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __POS_CASH_BALANCE__: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __credit_card_balance__: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __installments_payment__: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows the relationships among the tables. This will be very useful when we need to define relationships in featuretools. \n",

An entity in featuretools must have a unique index where none of the elements are duplicated.  Currently, only `app`, `bureau`, and `previous` have unique indices (`SK_ID_CURR`, `SK_ID_BUREAU`, and `SK_ID_PREV` respectively). For the other dataframes, we must pass in `make_index = True` and then specify the name of the index. Entities can also have time indices where each entry is identified by a unique time. (There are not datetimes in any of the data, but there are relative times, given in months or days, that we could consider treating as time variables).\n",

    "Slightly advanced note: we need **to be careful** to not create a [diamond graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_graph) where there are multiple paths from a parent to a child. If we directly link `app` and `cash` via `SK_ID_CURR`; `previous` and `cash` via `SK_ID_PREV`; and `app` and `previous` via `SK_ID_CURR`, then we have created two paths from `app` to `cash`. This results in ambiguity, so the approach we have to take instead is to link `app` to `cash` through `previous`. We establish a relationship between `previous` (the parent) and `cash` (the child) using `SK_ID_PREV`. Then we establish a relationship between `app` (the parent) and `previous` (now the child) using `SK_ID_CURR`. Then featuretools will be able to create features on `app` derived from both `previous` and `cash` by stacking multiple primitives. "

    "### Deep Feature Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) is the process featuretools uses to make new features. DFS stacks feature primitives to form features with a \"depth\" equal to the number of primitives. For example, if we take the maximum value of a client's previous loans (say `MAX(previous.loan_amount)`), that is a \"deep feature\" with a depth of 1. To create a feature with a depth of two, we could stack primitives by taking the maximum value of a client's average montly payments per previous loan (such as `MAX(previous(MEAN(installments.payment)))`). The [original paper on automated feature engineering using deep feature synthesis](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf) is worth a read. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform DFS in featuretools, we use the `dfs`  function passing it an `entityset`, the `target_entity` (where we want to make the features), the `agg_primitives` to use, the `trans_primitives` to use and the `max_depth` of the features. Here we will use the default aggregation and transformation primitives,  a max depth of 2, and calculate primitives for the `app` entity. Because this process is computationally expensive, we can run the function using `features_only = True` to return only a list of the features and not calculate the features themselves. This can be useful to look at the resulting features before starting an extended computation."

In other words, for a client with 5 total `bureau_balance` observations where 4 of the `STATUS` were `X`, the value of the `NormalizedModeCount` would be 0.8. The idea is to record not only the most common value, but also the relative frequency of the most common value compared to all observations.  \n",
